# JustWare API Training

Welcome!  We have been assigned to transfer an electronic filing from AgencyX into JustWare.  AgencyX will provide us with files that contain the data we need to process.  The main data file will be an XML document that we will need to parse and translate to the JustWare API.  Any other files will be PDF documents that will be added to the case.  AgencyX will only send one filing per case.  To avoid duplication of name data we are required to identify attorneys and defendants by the unique BAR and CMSID numbers provided.  The program will need to first check to see if a name exists by the unique identifier.
